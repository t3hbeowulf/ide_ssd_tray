# 1.8" ZIF to IDE 3.5" Tray
This is an OpenSCAD render of a custom 3.5" drive tray which holds a 1.8" ZIF to 40pin IDE Adapter and a 1.8" IDE HDD/SSD. This was created to give an old 128GB SSD hard drive a new home in one of my retro computer projects. The ZIF ribbon that came with the adapter is short and finiky so I felt it would be better to secure everything down in a formfactor that could be easily mounted

### Features
- A generic board support the ZIF to IDE adapter
- A flexible space to rest a 1.8" hard drive (I'm using double-sided tape to mount the drive)
- Mount holes matching a standard 3.5" HDD with a drive height of ~10mm

### Tools used to render
- Cura Slicer v4.8+
- OpenSCAD v2019.5+
